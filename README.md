# Bill Buster App

### Description
An app to help you keep track of all your bills, get a snapshot of your finances, and store your billing statements. 

Bill Buster is a mobile friendly app that allows users to log in to their virtual filing system. Users can input their billing information for any type that they may have, add and store picture copies of their statements, and get a quick look at the spread of their finances from the pie chart generated by their input data. Users must log in to be able to view their information. All routes beyond the landing page are protected. Bill Buster is designed to make managing your finances simpler and more comprehensive, without all the clutter.

### Developers
- John Waymire
- Lina Kichen
- Ryan McKenzie

### App configuration
Bill Buster uses GET and POST routes to handle data on a Express server connected to a mySQL database using a Sequelize ORM. Rendering of the app is handled by React and react-boostrap. Built using CRUD and MVP practices, Bill Buster is an example of a full stack MERN app.

### Components and Tasks
Each developer handled separate components of th app.

1. Lina: Database set up with mySQL and Sequelize (models, migrations, associations) Landing page with login and signup pages (front to back end functionality), user authentication

2. John:  Home page rendering that displays pie chart, forms for adding/updating bill categories and handling those changes to the database, logo design, app theme

3. Ryan: creating the interaction inside of each bill category and the add statement form, handling statement submission to database, setting up functionality to access computer/phone camera to take photos, storing images in database

## Future Features
1. Currently we have predefined bill categories that the user has access to, but we would like to allow users to create their own categories and store specific statements pertenant to that it. This is especially useful for our Utilities category, which currenlt stores many types of utility bills. This feature would definitely give the user more control over how they want to store their information. This would also make rendering of the pie chart more accurate as well.

2. Make statements searchable.
