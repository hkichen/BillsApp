# Deliverable 1 
### Project Overview
BillsBuster is an app intended to make keeping track of bills much easier. By allowing a user to store all their billing information in one safe place, they can more easily keep an organized history. This practical app may seem simple, but being able to easily keep track of all the bills could help prevent a user from missing payments in their busy life, keep track of their money, and reduce the physical clutter needed for storing paper statements.

### Mock Layouts
- This is the cover page layout, where a user can either sign up or log in. Signing up will add a new user in the database while logging in will go through Auth0 authentication. The sign up form will also ask for income and email.

- The Home Page will showcase the pie chart that breaks down the user's bills. It will also display what percent of monthly income is being spent on bills. It will be empty until they create their first folder and fill out the information. The form will prompt user for: bill/bill type name, bank/source of funds, due date,

- Once inside a folder, a user can see all the statements filed under that billing type. Users can take a photo of their statement and store it in the folder. Each statement will be added to the database's Statement table, and populated in the folder as a clickable link. Once they click on the link, the can view the picture of the statment. To add a statement, the use must fill out a form, access their camera, and submit.

# Deliverable 2

We hit a couple of unrecoverable snags and had to start an entirely new repo and write everything from scratch. 

# Deliverable 3

User authentication has been installed. App is visibly functional with polished front end, and components are working smoothly for the most part.

# Deliverable 4

Components have been improved. Expense and User API routes are working, and are talking to the databases.
